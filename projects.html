        <p>Here are some projects I've completed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/wastella/dalaipy">DalaiPy</a> -- DalaiPy is a simple library that creates low-level python bindings for Dalai, which is a abstraction of llama.cpp that allows the user to make a self-hosted server to interact with local LLMs</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/wastella/nasa-hackathon-proj">Agroeye</a> -- Agroeye is a tool that allows farmers to talk to a LLM about in-the-moment collected meteorological data to determine what the best course of action with their crops should be. It also generates interactive graphs to allow for better insights. You can see the website <a href="https://nasa-hackathon-proj.vercel.app/">here</a></li>  
            <li><a href="https://github.com/wastella/codeforcer">Codeforcer</a> -- Codeforcer is a tool that allows <i>competitive programmers</i> to check their answers and interact with a specialized AI about their codeforces problems, it takes the URL then scrapes the problem and automatically generates solutions and compares user code to the solution.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/wastella/gpt4all-todo-list">Smart Todo List</a> -- my "Smart" Todo list project uses gpt4all to automatically generate todo list entries based on an overall task, the user can input their overall task then follow the todo list entries and check them off as they finish them one by one </li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Zxchz/uselessButton">Useless Button</a> -- this was a hardware project I did with a group for a hackathon, we made an arduino microcontroller control a LCD screen, and the screen showed an image of a button and when the physical button was pressed it had a hand on the display come in and turn off the button</li>
        </ul>
